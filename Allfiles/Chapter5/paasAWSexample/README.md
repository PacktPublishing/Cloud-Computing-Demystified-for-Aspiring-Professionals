# Name of the project
## Cloud Computing Essentials for Beginners

> A brief description of your project.

>> Cloud Computing Essentials for Beginners is a compendious volume focused on educating beginning practitioners on how to master modern cloud computing essentials required to prepare for accreditation to succeed in any technology centric industry.

>> Initially youâ€™ll be enlightened on cloud computing and its various models. Then you will learn how to plan, and implement infrastructure services, platform services and configure software as a service types, this includes step-by-step demonstrations, review questions, and optimization recommendations derived from certified experts in the industry utilizing Microsoft, Amazon, and Google cloud computing services.

>> Cloud Computing Essentials for Beginners includes hands-on tutorials, and self-assessment questions. This easy-to-follow guide will teach you the essentials of cloud computing services.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get started.

1. Visitors can clone the repo to a local machine.
2. Create an AWS account.
    >a. Or use an existing AWS account.
3. AWS CLI; A command line tool for working with AWS services, including Amazon EKS. This example requires that you use version 2.4.9 or later.
4. kubectl; A command line tool for working with Kubernetes clusters. This example requires that you use version 1.21 or later.


what actually happens when you execute.

Creates a Kubernetes cluster and deploys an application.

### Initial Configuration

1. AWS account is required.

## Developing

This example does not include step-by-step instructions.
Readers are recommended to return and attempt recreating these examples after they have read the entire cloud computing essentials for beginners book.

### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

> 1. Deploy a cluster
> 2. Configure cluster communication
> 3. Deploy nodes
> 4. Deploy application with kubectl CLI


a. Save the file named eks-sample-deployment.yaml , located at the directory path: ~/Allfiles/Chapter5/paasAWSexample/ to your local machine.


b. Save the file named eks-sample-service.yaml , located at the directory path: ~/Allfiles/Chapter5/paasAWSexample/ to your local machine.


## Features

What can the features for this project accomplish?
* What's the main functionality?
>Amazons EKS improves the process, from creating a cluster to deploying and operating your applications.

### Architecting
> Optionally readers can design a cloud computing architecture similar to examples illustrated in the book.
>> Readers can use the pptx, powerpoint file and architecting icons located in this directory to support diagramming a cloud computing PaaS resource.
