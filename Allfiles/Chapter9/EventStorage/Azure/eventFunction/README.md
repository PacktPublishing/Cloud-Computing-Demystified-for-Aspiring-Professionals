## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get started.

```code to automate or manual task
<place holder> Example: System.Console.WriteLine("Fast Lane rocks!");
```

what actually happens when you execute.

example output: Fast Lane rocks!

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration.
This is the section where you would document those requirements.



## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

``` code to automate or manual task
<place holder> Example: System.Console.WriteLine("Fast Lane rocks!");
```

And state what happens step-by-step.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:

```code to automate or manual task
<place holder> Example: System.Console.WriteLine("Fast Lane rocks!");
```


### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```code to automate or manual task
<place holder> Example: System.Console.WriteLine("Fast Lane rocks!");
```

Explain what the previous code actually does.

branch. Pull (colloborative review) requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.

## Links
