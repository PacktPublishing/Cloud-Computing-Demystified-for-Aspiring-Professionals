## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get started.

1. Visitors can clone the repo or download seperately the sample templates to a local machine.
    a. Sample solutions templates show you how to create an end-to-end solution with common applications.
2. Create a Google Cloud Platform account.
    a. Use an existing Google Cloud Platform account.
3. Review how to use cloud deployment manager.
4. Import the templates and configuration file labeled with extensions .py, .py.schema, and .yaml from the directory path ~/Allfiles/Chapter4/iaasAWSexample/ to your local or remote storage directory.


what actually happens when you execute.
