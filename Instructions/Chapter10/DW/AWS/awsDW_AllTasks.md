# Chapter 8 : 


## Why?

Traditional and modern development projects still recommend technical and non-technical controls to be properly assessed. In this case, we started our tutorial by understanding the importance of analyzing the cloud networking service resources before further development. After a thorough but insightful analysis of our network resources, organizations can consider implementing thier line of business application or service in a VPC.
