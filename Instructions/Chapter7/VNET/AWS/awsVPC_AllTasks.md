# Chapter 7 : Implementing an AWS VPC


## Why?

Technical and non-technical controls can be analyzed. In this case, we started our tutorial by understanding the importance of examining the cloud networking service resources before further development and testing. If approved, implement in production to securely host our organization's line of business application or service.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will:

+ Task 1: Describe and configure a VPC
+ Task 2: Describe and configure a CIDR
+ Task 3: Describe and configure subnets
+ Task 4: Describe and configure an internet gateway
+ Task 5: Describe and configure routing


## Instructions

## Exercise 0

### Task 0: Setup and configure prerequisites

In this task, you will review and setup all required prerequisites

1. Review and follow suggested instructions located in a file named README.md located in the directory ~/Cloud-Computing-for-Beginners/tree/main/Instructions/Chapter7/VNET/AWS

> Note: After reviewing and complying with all required prerequisites denoted in the file mentioned above return to this file and continue to the next exercise task.

### Exercise 1

#### Task 1: Describe and configure a VPC

In this task, you will implement a VPC by using the AWS management console.

> Amazon provides a preconfigured VPC in every AWS geographical region. The VPC is labeled default VPC... For further information and examples read the book titled Cloud Computing Essentials for Beginners.

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/).

1. In the console, navigate and select **Services**, and on the **Services** section, navigate and select **Networking & Content Delivery**.

1.  In the Networking & Content Delivery section select VPC.

1.	In the VPC Dashboard navigate and select Launch VPC Wizard.

1.	Insight: Do not modify any fields or sections unless explicitly instructed. For example, If the author circumvents an option which appears  as a button or box or name field or metadata itâ€™s intentional. These options or settings are already configured by the system, and I will refer to as the default settings.

1.	Review the VPC dashboard, Create VPC wizard sections labeled VPC settings, VPC, Subnets, and Route tables.

1.  Insight: The VPC dashboard configuration section labeled Create a VPC streamlines the manual configuration... For further information please read the book titled Cloud Computing Essentials for Beginners.

#### Task 2: Describe and configure a CIDR

In this task, you will define a CIDR by using the Launch VPC Wizard.

In cloud computing, virtual networks require network administrators to define the starting IP and the size of the VPC using... For further information read the book titled Cloud Computing Essentials for Beginners.

1.	In the IPv4 CIDR block field review the default settings. Analyze the IPs available, 65,536 IPs are listed.

1.	The calculation was performed automatically.

1.	Update the IPv4 CIDR block field to 10.0.0.0/18. Analyze the IPs available, how many are listed?

1.	Review the Availability Zones (AZs) options. Analyze the recommendation denoted, at least two AZs for high availability.

1.	Remember, in chapter 3 titled Understanding the Benefits of Public Clouds (AWS, Azure, and GCP) we described the Fault Tolerant Infrastructure which explained Availability Zones (AZ).

#### Task 3: Describe and configure subnets

In this task, you will define and configure VPC subnets.
