5.	After reviewing the categories, locate the search field and type the following: Virtual Machines.

7.	In the search results area, review the filter options, such as Services and Documentation. Like AWS, Azure not only helps you accelerate development but also empowers the end user to learn while doing. Take note of the Documentation section in the search results. The Documentation section includes resource links to educate you on Azure Virtual Machines.

9.	Review the icons listed in the top-right corner of the Azure portal. Select the Support + troubleshooting icon and review the menu options

8.	Like the AWS Management Console, the Azure portalâ€™s Support + troubleshooting feature includes an area where you can create and review your support requests in addition to reviewing overall service health and learning resources.

> **Note**: If you did not have an opportunity to learn how to use the Azure portal by creating a resource, then I recommend revisiting Chapter 8.
